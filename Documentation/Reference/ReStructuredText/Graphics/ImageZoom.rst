===================================
Image zoom and lightbox features
===================================

..  versionadded:: 0.36.0
    The image zoom feature was introduced in render-guides version 0.36.0.

The TYPO3 documentation theme provides built-in image zoom and lightbox
features to enhance the viewing experience for images and figures. These
features allow readers to view images in greater detail without leaving
the documentation page.

.. _image-zoom-modes:

Available zoom modes
--------------------

The zoom functionality is controlled by the `:zoom:` option on figure
and image directives. The following zoom modes are available:

..  rst-class:: dl-parameters

`lightbox`
    Click to open the image in a full-screen overlay dialog. The lightbox
    provides a dark backdrop and centers the image. Click outside the image
    or press Escape to close. A zoom indicator icon appears on the image.

    **Use case**: Screenshots, diagrams, and any image that benefits from
    full-screen viewing. This is the recommended mode for most images.

`gallery`
    Click to open the image in a gallery viewer with mouse wheel zoom
    and navigation between grouped images. Use the `:gallery:` option to
    group related images together.

    **Use case**: Series of screenshots, step-by-step tutorials, or image
    collections that should be navigable together.

`inline`
    Enables scroll wheel zoom directly on the image without opening an
    overlay. When zoomed, drag to pan. Double-click or press Escape to reset.

    **Use case**: Detailed diagrams or technical drawings that need frequent
    zoom inspection without leaving context.

`lens`
    A magnifier lens follows the cursor when hovering over the image,
    showing a zoomed view. A result panel appears beside the image with
    the magnified area.

    **Use case**: High-resolution images with fine details, such as UI
    mockups or detailed screenshots.

.. _image-zoom-options:

Directive options
-----------------

The following options are available for the figure and image directives:

..  rst-class:: dl-parameters

`:zoom:`
    The zoom mode to use. One of: `lightbox`, `gallery`, `inline`, `lens`.

`:gallery:`
    Group name for gallery mode. Images with the same gallery name can be
    navigated together. Only used with `:zoom: gallery`.

`:zoom-indicator:`
    Whether to show the zoom indicator icon. Set to `false` to hide it.
    Default is `true` (shown).

`:zoom-factor:`
    Magnification factor for lens mode. Default is `2`. Higher values
    provide stronger magnification. Only used with `:zoom: lens`.

    *   :kbd:`Escape` - Close lightbox/gallery
    *   :kbd:`Arrow Left` / :kbd:`Arrow Right` - Navigate between images (gallery)
    *   :kbd:`+` / :kbd:`-` - Zoom in/out (gallery)

*   **Inline zoom mode**: Full keyboard support

    *   :kbd:`Tab` - Focus the image

All zoom modes maintain proper ARIA attributes and provide descriptive
labels for assistive technologies. Always use the `:alt:` option to
provide descriptive alternative text for images.

.. _image-zoom-reduced-motion:

Reduced motion support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The zoom functionality respects the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
When reduced motion is preferred, transitions and animations are disabled.

.. _image-zoom-best-practices:

Best practices
--------------

*   Always include descriptive `:alt:` text for accessibility
*   Use `lightbox` as the default for most images
*   Use `:gallery:` to group related images for navigation
*   Use `inline` for technical diagrams that need frequent inspection
*   Combine with `:class: with-border with-shadow` for better visual presentation
*   Test zoom functionality with keyboard navigation
