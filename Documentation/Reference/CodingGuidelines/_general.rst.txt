Introduction to MyExt
=====================

This extension provides a simple way to display weather data.

*   It fetches data from an external API and processes it in a way that allows
    it to be cached and reused efficiently throughout the TYPO3 site.
*   The results are cached for performance.
*   You can configure the output in the backend.

This extension is compatible with TYPO3 v12 and above.
