===========================================
How to Contribute to Official Documentation
===========================================

The community is welcome to make changes to the official documentation
on https://docs.typo3.org. Any help is appreciated!

You can start with very minimal knowledge and learn as
you go along.

Your changes will not be visible right away, someone
must merge them. So, don't worry about breaking something!

If you're stuck at any point, don't hesitate
to :ref:`ask for help <how-to-get-help>`.

There are 2 different workflows which you can use to make changes.
Use what you are most comfortable with!

.. tip::

   We recommend to try out the :ref:`"Edit on GitHub" workflow <docs-contribute-github-method>`,
   because it is a way to quickly make changes, but use :ref:`"Local Editing and Rendering
   with Docker" <docs-contribute-git-docker>` in the long run for larger
   changes.

   1. "Edit on GitHub" workflow

      You can edit documentation directly online in your browser.

      This workflow can be used for minor changes.

      For extensive changes, it is recommended to use "Local Editing
      and Rendering with Docker".

      **Get started:** :ref:`docs-contribute-github-method`.

   2. "Local Editing and Rendering with Docker" workflow

      If you are familiar with Git, Docker and the command line,
      you can use this workflow. In fact, it is recommended.

      If you already contributed to other projects on GitHub via
      pull requests, you should already be familiar with this workflow.
      The only difference to a general GitHub contribution workflow
      using Git is the local rendering with Docker!

      **Get started:** :ref:`docs-contribute-git-docker`
