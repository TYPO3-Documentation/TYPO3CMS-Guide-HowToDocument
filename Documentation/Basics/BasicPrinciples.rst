Basic principles
=================

TYPO3 documentation is written in **reStructuredText (reST)** and rendered to
HTML using a shared toolchain. Most documentation is hosted on
https://docs.typo3.org and follows a common structure and style.

Contributing to official documentation
======================================

Everyone is welcome to contribute to TYPO3â€™s official documentation.

Most manuals are hosted on GitHub. You can suggest changes directly by clicking
:guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` on any page.

For larger contributions or local editing, see the full guide at
:ref:`docs-contribute`.

..  _doc-type-extension-manual:

Documenting your own extension
==============================

To document your TYPO3 extension, create a :file:`Documentation` folder in your
extension and add `.rst` files following the standard structure.

If your extension is hosted on GitHub and correctly configured, contributors
can use the :guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` button to propose changes.

See :ref:`how-to-start-docs-extension` to get started with the recommended setup.
