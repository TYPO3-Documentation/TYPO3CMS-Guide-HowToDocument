Basic principles
=================

TYPO3 documentation is written in **reStructuredText (reST)** and rendered to
HTML using a shared toolchain. Most documentation is hosted on
https://docs.typo3.org and follows a common structure and style.

Rendering

Rendering converts `.rst` source files into styled HTML output. You can preview
docs locally using the official Docker container:

..  include:: /_Includes/_LocalRendering.rst.txt

Contributing to official documentation
======================================

Everyone is welcome to contribute to TYPO3â€™s official documentation.

Most manuals are hosted on GitHub. You can suggest changes directly by clicking
:guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` on any page.

For larger contributions or local editing, see the full guide at
:ref:`docs-contribute`.

..  _doc-type-extension-manual:

Documenting your own extension
==============================

To document your TYPO3 extension, create a :file:`Documentation` folder in your
extension and add `.rst` files following the standard structure.

We provide a Docker command to get started with documenting an extension:

..  include:: /_Includes/_InitCommand.rst.txt
