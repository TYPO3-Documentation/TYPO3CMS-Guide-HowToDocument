Spelling, terms and glossary
============================

.. index:: pair: Text role; pn (proper name)

*Highly recommended:* Make use of text role `pn` (proper name) to mark up
special names like `TYPO3 Core Team`:pn:. The recommended way of writing this
isis:

.. code-block:: rst

   `TYPO3 Core Team`:pn:

Put `:pn:` to the end of the text. This facilitates reading the source.
Currently the 'pn' text role is defined in file :file:`Includes.rst.txt`. It is
a derivative of 'emphasis' and shown in italics. We are free to change that in
our theme. A future Sphinx will be able to automatically create a sorted list
of all proper names used.
