* Daniele Procida: `"What nobody tells you about documentation <https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/>`__
  (May 19, 2017) - A very good blogpost about different kind of manuals.

general writing tips:

* `"8 Tips for Better Readability" by Roby Collinge
  <https://usabilla.com/blog/8-guidelines-for-better-readability-on-the-web/>`__
  is a very good resource. However, some of the tips do not concern you as
  a writer. They are only relevant for theme development. As a writer, skip
  right down to tip 5.
* `Neil Patel: How to Write With Clarity: 9 Tips for Simplifying Your Message <https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-with-clarity-tips>`__
  This is also not an article that is specific to documentation, but the tips
  are very good and general, especially for writing in clarity in mind.
